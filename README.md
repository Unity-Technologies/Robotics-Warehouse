## Introduction

This repository contains a configurable warehouse environment that is ready for use in robotics simulation. The project comes in two formats: a standalone [Unity project](WarehouseProject/), and as a [Unity package](com.unity.robotics.warehouse/package.json).

You can see the warehouse in action in our [Navigation 2 SLAM Example](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Nav2-SLAM-Example)!

> This repository has been adapted from the [Unity Simulation Sample Project: Warehouse Robot](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-simulation-sample-project-warehouse-robot-176606).

## Getting Started
To use the warehouse in your own project, check out the [Usage](Documentation/Usage.md) documentation.
