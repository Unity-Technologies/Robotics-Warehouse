## Introduction

This repository contains a configurable warehouse environment that is ready for use in robotics simulation. The project comes in multiple formats: standalone Unity projects in the Universal Render Pipeline and the High Definition Render Pipeline, and as a Unity packages, similarly in URP and HDRP.

You can see the warehouse in action in our [Navigation 2 SLAM Example](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Nav2-SLAM-Example)!

> This repository has been adapted from the [Unity Simulation Sample Project: Warehouse Robot](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-simulation-sample-project-warehouse-robot-176606).

## Getting Started
